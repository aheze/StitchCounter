**An app to count your crochet pattern's stitches!** Made with SwiftUI with no 3rd party dependencies. [Mac app](https://github.com/aheze/StitchCounter/raw/main/Assets/StitchCounter.zip) • [iOS app](https://github.com/aheze/StitchCounter/raw/main/Assets/StitchCounter.ipa)


### Purpose
To count the number of stitches in a crochet pattern. My sister runs an Etsy shop, [StuffingStuff](https://www.etsy.com/shop/StuffingStuff), which sells crochet stuff and patterns. Supposedly, manually counting stitches to make a pattern is very tedious and error-prone. This app makes it easy.

> Crochet is a process of creating textiles by using a crochet hook to interlock loops of yarn, thread, or strands of other materials. The name is derived from the French term crochet, meaning 'small hook'.
